# Authentication & Route Protection System

## Overview
The alumni network system now has comprehensive authentication and route protection implemented to handle user sessions properly and prevent unauthorized access.

## Key Components

### 1. Route Guard (`components/auth/route-guard.tsx`)
- **Purpose**: Protects pages by checking authentication status and user roles
- **Features**:
  - Checks if user is authenticated
  - Validates user roles (admin, moderator, alumni)
  - Redirects unauthorized users to login
  - Shows loading state during authentication checks
  - Waits for Redux rehydration from localStorage

### 2. Enhanced Login Form (`components/auth/login-form.tsx`)
- **Purpose**: Handles user authentication with proper state management
- **Features**:
  - Saves token and user data to localStorage
  - Updates Redux store with authentication state
  - Redirects based on user role after login
  - Prevents already authenticated users from seeing login form
  - Shows loading state during redirects

## Authentication Flow

### 1. Initial Page Load
```
1. App starts → Redux Provider initializes
2. Redux Provider checks localStorage for token/user
3. If found, dispatches setAuthFromStorage action
4. Route Guard checks authentication status
5. If authenticated, renders protected content
6. If not authenticated, redirects to login
```

### 2. Login Process
```
1. User submits login form
2. API call to /auth/login endpoint
3. On success:
   - Save token and user to localStorage
   - Update Redux store with setAuthFromStorage
   - Redirect based on user role:
     - admin → /admin/dashboard
     - moderator → /moderator/dashboard  
     - alumni → /dashboard
4. On failure, show error message
```

## Protected Routes

### Admin Routes (Require admin role)
- `/admin/dashboard` - Admin dashboard with system overview
- `/admin/users` - User management interface

### General Routes (Require any authenticated user)
- `/dashboard` - Main user dashboard

### Public Routes (No authentication required)
- `/auth/login` - Login page (redirects if authenticated)

## Usage Examples

### Protecting a Page
```tsx
import { RouteGuard } from "@/components/auth/route-guard"

export default function ProtectedPage() {
  return (
    <RouteGuard requiredRole="admin">
      <AdminContent />
    </RouteGuard>
  )
}
```

## Environment Setup

Create `.env.local` file:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
